  ## Description
  This is my 14-Challenge. In this challenge I had to create everything from scratch. I was given specific parameters to accomplish. I was to create a blogging website that users have to login to perform actions and view specific pages and elements of the application. This was one of the more challenging programs so far. I took a lot of time to understand every aspect of this project. I tried keeping my code easy to read and worked on removing redundancies. In the end it was supper enjoyable and I learned a ton doing this on my own.
